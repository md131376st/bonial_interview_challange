## 1. System Structure

### Classes and Methods

#### Interfaces
- **`IUserPreferences`**
  - **Responsibility**: Fetches user data.

- **`IContentInfo`**
  - **Responsibility**: Fetches content data.

- **`IStrategy`**
  - **Responsibility**: A/B testing 

#### Core Service
- **`ContentReorderService`**
     - **Responsibility**: provide the sorting service

## 2. Scalability and Challenges

### Potential Challenges
1. **Performance**: Large content lists => latency in sorting and fetching.
2. **Memory Overhead**: Memory and network Overhead


### solution
- **Chunks**: Process content data in chunks (use spark)
- **Caching**: use redis or 
- **Optimized Sorting**: change sort algorithms
- **Index**: for content data
- **spark**: calculating priority

### Stack

The stack depends on the kind of database and other technologies used within the company. Below are recommendations based on different scenarios:

#### If Python is used:
- **SQL Databases**:
  - Use **Django** to organize and manage database connections efficiently.
- **NoSQL Databases**:
  - Use **FastAPI** for lightweight and scalable applications.

#### Parallel/Bash Processing:
- For task scheduling and parallel processing:
  - Use **Celery** for distributed task queues.
  - Use **PySpark** for large-scale parallel data processing.

#### Deployment:
- **Dockerize** the application for consistency across environments.
- Ensure access to disk storage systems like **S3** for handling large datasets that do not fit into memory.
